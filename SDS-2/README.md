# SDS-2

This is the folder for the second part of the SDS course.

Both the project and the homework were made by me.

## HW

The hw contains, more or less, the program of the first two months of the course.

Keywords:
  * Bayesian framework
  * Acceptance-Rejection Algorithm
  * De Finetti representation theorem
  * MCMC algorithm (Gibbs, Metorpolis Hastings)
  * Markow chain


## PROJECT

The project is the final part of the exam, there are only a few guidelines to follow, for the rest you can choose any type of topic.

### TOPIC
My project concerns the prediction, by means of Bayesian inference methods, of the PM10 levels in the air in the city where there is no such detector, analyzing what happens in nearby cities.

I used a huge [dataset](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/) with many air quality records from around the world.

Keywords:
  * Data cleaning
  * Jags
  * Imputation of Missing values (via Bayesian inference)
  * Metropolis Hasting
