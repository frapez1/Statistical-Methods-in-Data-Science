# SDS-1

This is the folder with the most relevant hw for the first part of the SDS course.

These are project carried out in groups of 2 people.

## HW-1
This hw contains two different exercises that both require the creation of an R script.

### EX-1
This exercise aims to analyze how a seemingly random game can, thanks to a little trick, actually benefit one of the two players a lot.

Keywords:
  * Probability
  * [Penney's game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penney%27s_game)
  * [s The Humble-Nishiyama Randomness Game](http://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/Humble-Nishiyama%20Randomness%20Game%20-%20A%20New%20Variation%20on%20Penney%27s%20Coin%20Game.pdf)
  * Monte Carlo simulation


### EX-2
The main purpose of this exercise is to analyze the effectiveness of a streaming algorithm within a network switch.

Keywords:
  * Streaming model
  * [Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma)
  * Simulation

## HW-3

For this hw we are required to compare two estimators of the population mean: the sample average and the median-of-means (MoM) both in the univariate and multivariate case with differents type of distributions.

Keywords:
  * Mean estimators
  * MoM
  * Multivariate
  * Heavy/light tailed dustrubutions
